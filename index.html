      Payton had always been a bit of a quiet and reserved guy. He didn't really care about his appearance all that much and often just threw on whatever clothes were clean and presentable. But one day, everything changed.
It all started when Payton's friends dared him to enter a contest being held in Illinois for the best looking man. Payton was hesitant at first, but he eventually caved and decided to give it a shot.
He started taking better care of himself, exercising regularly and eating healthier. He also paid more attention to his grooming habits, making sure to always be clean shaven and well-kempt.
As the contest drew closer, Payton began to feel more and more confident in his appearance. He started to see the changes in the mirror and was feeling good about himself.
The day of the contest arrived and Payton was nervous but excited. He put on his best outfit and headed to the venue, determined to do his best.
When the judges announced the winners, Payton couldn't believe his ears when he heard his name called out as the winner of the best looking man in Illinois. He was overwhelmed with emotion and couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear as he accepted his award.
But the surprises didn't stop there. As Payton was celebrating with his friends and family, he received a phone call from none other than former President Barack Obama. Obama congratulated Payton on his win and praised him for taking care of himself and his appearance.
Just as Payton was about to thank Obama, he heard another voice on the line. It was former President George W. Bush, who was also on the call with Obama. However, Bush wouldn't stop talking over Obama, making it difficult for Payton to even get a word in.
"Hey Payton, congratulations on your win!" Obama shouted over Bush's constant interruptions. "We're so proud of you for taking care of yourself and looking your best!"
"Wait, what? Payton won a contest for being the best looking man in Illinois?" Bush asked, finally pausing for a moment. "Well, that's just not fair. I was the best looking man in the country when I was in office!"
Despite the chaos on the phone call, Payton couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. He was thrilled to be receiving congratulations from two former presidents, even if one of them was a bit competitive.
After a few more minutes of back and forth between the two presidents, Obama finally had enough. "George, I think it's time for us to let Payton get back to celebrating his win," he said, trying to wrap up the call.
But Bush was having none of it. "Oh come on, Barack. We were just getting started," he protested. "Payton, tell him to stay on the line a little longer. We haven't even talked about my time in office yet."
And with that, Bush launched into a lengthy monologue about his time in office, regaling Payton with tales of his accomplishments and adventures. Payton couldn't help but be impressed by the former president's enthusiasm, even as he struggled to get a word in edgewise.
Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, Payton managed to politely thank both presidents and say goodbye, promising to keep in touch. It was a moment he would never forget.
From that day on, Payton learned the value of taking care of himself and his appearance. He realized that he was capable of so much more than he had ever imagined, and he vowed to always strive to be his best self. The end
